            My name is Victor Almeida França, currently I'm finishing my
            Computer Science degree and I'm a fullstack WEB developer, mostly
            focusing on the backend side. My main stack involves a lot of
            Javascript, creating RESTfull and GraphQL APIs with Express in
            NodeJS and building frontend applications with React and Angular. I
            have a little bit of experience with Python in WEB development too,
            using Flask to create APIs.
          </p>
          <p className="me">
            Regarding my technologies skills, I have experience dealing with
            HTTP requests to create powerfull RESTful and GraphQL APIs,
            relational and non-relational databases (SQL, MongoDB),
            authorization and authentication both in back-end and front-end
            using the latest technologies (JWT, OAuth..), MVC design pattern,
            server-side and client-side rendering, websockets for real-time apps
            such as chats and social-media. Regarding deployment I like to use
            Docker to encapsulate my projects, Amazon AWS services and Digital
            Ocean droplets and clusters to host them, and I'm currently studying
            Kubernetes and container orchestration to easily scale projects.
          </p>
          <p className="me">
            I love everything that involves technology, it beeing developing
            applications, studying or even just watching conferences and getting
            to be up to date with what's trending.
          </p>
          <p className="me">
            I have a lot to discover and yet to learn and I'm more than excited
            to gradualy climb my way into being a successful professional doing
            what I love the most.
